	Preliminary Characterization of \\ the American Gut Population
}

\vspace{0.5cm}

As of \releaseDate{}, we have completed sequencing and analysis of gut, skin, and oral bacteria from the first \numSamples{} samples of \numParticipants{} participants in the American Gut study.  This document gives us a summary of the most up-to-date results for the whole population. 

Here we compare the American Gut population to other populations who have had their gut, oral, and skin bacteria characterized.  We then describe the participants in the study, show the major kinds of bacteria in the gut microbiota of the American Gut population, and provide some information about what affects gut bacteria (as well as show that some variables such as gender have surprisingly little effect).

{\em Technical note: ``microbiota'' refers to a particular community of microbes, including bacteria (e.g., the human gut microbiota); ``microbiome'' refers to the genes those microbes contain (e.g., the human gut microbiome). Most participants in American Gut have signed up for characterization of the microbiota.}

% HEADING 1.1
\colorbox{agpFlesh}{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{1mm} \LARGE \centering A map of your microbes \vspace{1mm}}}

A useful way to compare thousands of microbiota samples at the same time is by putting them on a map where more similar samples are closer together, and more dissimilar ones are further apart.

{\bf Figure 1A} shows how the microbes from different parts of the body relate to one another: as you can see, the fecal (gut), oral and skin microbiota form three points of a triangle, reflecting the major differences between these body locations. (Amazingly, even the same person has essentially none of the same bacteria in their skin, their mouth, and their gut.) In these figures, we compare the data from American Gut to the data from the Human Microbiome Project, a \$173 million initiative funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) to characterize both the microbiota and the microbiome of 300 healthy subjects. Broadly, the American Gut data are very comparable to the Human Microbiome Project data, and to several other projects.

{\bf Figure 1B} highlights the data from participants in the Personal Genome Project, who have agreed to make their genome data publicly available and who have also had their microbes characterized in the mouth, feces and skin through American Gut.

We have sequenced \numSamples{} microbiota samples from \numParticipants{} people, including \pgpParticipants{} participants in the Personal Genome Project. We are just getting started, but already this number substantially exceeds the number of participants in other recent high-profile studies, including the Human Microbiome Project and the Global Gut study, which were published in the same issue of the scientific journal {\em Nature} last year.

% HEADING 3.1
\colorbox{agpRust}{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{1mm} \LARGE \centering \textcolor{white}{What kinds of microbes are in different sample types?} \vspace{1mm}}}

Just as seeing the major types of plants and animals (say, oaks versus pine trees) can give you a broad idea of what a traditional ecosystem looks like, knowing who is in your gut or mouth or skin provides a useful guide to what is going on in there.  Different parts of the body have very different microbes, as shown above in {\bf Figure 1}, but also at the same body site, different people have very different microbes. For example, some people have over 90\% Firmicutes in the gut, whereas other people have less than 1\%. Understanding the reasons for these differences is a major goal of the American Gut project.

The figures below show results at the level of bacterial phyla: a phylum is a big branch on the evolutionary tree of life. (For context, all arthropods, from shrimp to spiders, belong to a single phylum.) Many bacteria can be present in the gut, but not all are present in great numbers. For example, {\em E. coli} is  thought of as a classic gut bacterium because it is good at growing on a petri dish, not because it is a main component of the gut. At the phylum taxonomic level, the major players are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Firmicutes include \emph{Clostridium} and \emph{Lactobacillus} species and many producers of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Bacteroidetes includes \emph{Bacteroides} and \emph{Prevotella}, both of which break down polysaccharides (big sugars).

% HEADING 5.1
\colorbox{agpRust}{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{1mm} \LARGE \centering \textcolor{white}{How much have we seen of the American Gut?} \vspace{1mm}}}

The gut is a complex ecosystem, far more like a rainforest than a desert.  Additionally, every person has a different mix of microbes in their gut.  Therefore, to truly understand how many kinds of microbes there are, we have to sample many people.  The AGP has sampled many more people than any other project, including the HMP. Therefore, for the types of people that participate in the AGP, we understand the range of kinds of microbes that exist. Now we just need to understand why and what factors affect them.

Adding more samples does not increase the number of new mixes of gut bacteria we see.}

As we saw in the last section, different people differ dramatically in what lives in their gut. Many factors, including antibiotic use, are known to change the composition of gut microbiota. But which of the many possible factors has the largest effect? Here we examine the effects of several factors that might affect your gut bacteria.

Average composition across many people is far less variable than the individual-level results shown in {\bf Figure~4}. This demonstrates that a lot of the variability we see is just differences between individuals and not the result of age or exercise or the other factors considered here. However, we do see some statistically significant differences: for example, younger people, especially babies, have more Proteobacteria (as expected from other published results), and vegetarians and vegans have fewer Proteobacteria (which technically means vegans are less like babies than are meat eaters; go figure). Antibiotic use within the past month or the past week also has a substantial effect at this level, although other research has shown that the results depend on which antibiotic it is and what was in that person's gut to begin with.}

% HEADING 5.1
\colorbox{agpBlue}{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{1mm} \LARGE \centering \textcolor{white}{Where do you fit in?} \vspace{1mm}}}

By comparing our results to studies that include participants from other parts of the world, we can see where our American Gut fits into the global picture.  People from different countries tend to have different gut microbes, probably due to distinct diets.  However, there are also factors, like age, that impact gut bacteria similarly, regardless of what country a person lives in.
